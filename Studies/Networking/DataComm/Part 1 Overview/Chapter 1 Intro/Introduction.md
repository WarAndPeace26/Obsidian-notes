# Introduction

### 1.1 Data Communications
Fundamental Characteristics: 
1. *Delivery*: Data must be received by the intended device/ user 
2. *Accuracy*: Data must not be altered
3. *Timeliness*: Data send after it was needed is useless.
4. *Jitter*: Uneven delay between data packets.
***
#### Components
The 5 components are:
1. Message
2. Sender
3. Receiver
4. Transmission Medium
5. Protocol: The sending and receiving devices have to have a protocol. Otherwise they'd be *connected but not communicating* like a French man and a Japanese man.
***
#### Data Representation
- Text
- Numbers
- Images
- Audio
- Video

***
#### Data Flow
1. Simplex
2. Half-duplex
3. Full - Duplex
***
***
### 1.2 Networks
*Nodes* -> Devices
#### Distributed Processing
Dividing the work among lotsa machines
***
#### Network Criteria
1. *Performance:* Measured based on #throughput and #delay
2. *Reliability:* Measured by the **Frequency of failures**
3. *Security:*
> - Unauthorized access
> - protection from damage and development
> - Implementing anti-breach and data loss policies

***
#### Physical Structures
Types of Connection:
1. Point to point
2. Multi-point 
***
##### Physical Topology
1. Mesh
2. Star
3. Bus
4. Ring
5. Hybrid
***

#### Network Models
1. OSI (Open Systems Interconnection): 7 Layers
2. The Internet: 5 Layers
***
#### Categories of Networks
1. LAN
2. WAN
	1. Switched WAN (Connects End systems)
	2. point-to-point: LAN(Connects home to the internet *Through ISP*)
3. MAN

### 1.3 The Internet
#### ISPs
##### International ISP
Connects *nations*.

##### National ISPs
The backbone of national internet. 
*NAPs* -> Network Access Points: Switching Stations run by third parties
*Peering points* -> Where National ISPs are connected to each other.
Up to 600 Mbps

##### Regional ISPs
Third level on the hierarchy

##### Local ISPs
- A company that provides Internet Services
- A corporation with a network that provides services to its employees.
- nonprofit such as colleges or universities.

### 1.4 Protocols and Standards
#### Protocols
- *Syntax:* The arrangement of the bits.
- *Semantics:* The interpretation of the combinations/patterns of the bits
- *Timing:* When the send and how long to send.
***
#### Standards
- De Jure: Recognized by Law.
- De Facto: Not recognized. Set by manufacturers

##### Standard Organizations
1. ISO
2. IEEE

##### Internet Standards
- Internet Draft
	- `Unofficial document with a 6 month lifetime`
	- Request for Comment
		- `A draft that has been recommended by the Internet Authority`
			- Internet Standard
