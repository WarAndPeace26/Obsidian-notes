***
When a router receives an IP Datagram, it *decapsulates and encapsulates* it. 
- The format and size of the **Received** frame depends on the protocol of the physical network it had been traveling by. 
- The format and size of the **Sent** frame depends on the protocol of the Physical network it will be traveling by.

For example,
> If a router connects a LAN to a WAN, it will receive a frame in the LAN format and sends a frame in the WAN format
