# Introduction

### Data Communications
Fundamental Characteristics: 
1. *Delivery*: Data must be received by the intended device/ user 
2. *Accuracy*: Data must not be altered
3. *Timeliness*: Data send after it was needed is useless.
4. *Jitter*: Uneven delay between data packets.

#### Components
The 5 components are:
1. Message
2. Sender
3. Receiver
4. Transmission Medium
5. Protocol: The sending and receiving devices have to have a protocol. Other wise they'd be *connected but not communicating* like a French man and a Japanese man.

#### Data Representation
- Text
- Numbers
- Images
- Audio
- Video
#### Data Flow
1. Simplex
2. Half-duplex
3. Full - Duplex

### Networks
*Nodes* -> Devices
#### Distributed Processing
Dividing the work among lotsa machines
#### Network Criteria
1. *Performance:* Measured based on #throughput and #delay
2. *Reliability:* Measured by the **Frequency of failures**
3. *Security:*
> - Unauthorized access
> - protection from damage and development
> - Implementing anti-breach and data loss policies
#### Physical Structures
Types of Connection:
1. Point to point
2. Multi-point 

##### Physical Topology
1. Mesh
2. Star
3. Bus
4. Ring
5. Hybrid


#### Network Models
1. OSI (Open Systems Interconnection): 7 Layers
2. The Internet: 5 Layers

#### Categories of Networks
1. LAN
2. WAN
	1. Switched WAN (Connects End systems)
	2. point-to-point: LAN(Connects home to the internet *Through ISP*)
3. MAN
