# Non-Ideal Reflection/Refraction
***
![[Pasted image 20210818232118.png]]
In order to get Non-ideal reflection and refraction (Because they are more realistic looking), instead of casting 1 *Reflected/Refracted Ray*, we cast multiple for each ray (at a slightly altered angle).

We take an **Average** of the rays that reflect or refract for a more realistic looking scenery.

```ad-note
title: Soft Shadows

The same is done to get *Soft Shadows* instead of *Hard Shadows*

Casting multiple Shadow rays causes the shadows to look more realistic too.
