# Refraction
***
At first, the vector I is divided into its components. 
```ad-attention

Notice that the direction of *I* is away from the Normal. 

```
And then M is represented using I and N. I is the incident vector and N is the Normal. They are easier (No use of Trigonometry here) to find than M.

The derivation itself is just intended to get rid of the Trigonometric operations because the 3D engine simply handles vector calculations better.
