# Ray Representation
***
Rays are represented as 
```ad-info
title: Ray Explicit Equation

P(t) = origin + t*Direction

```
Here, origin is the *[[Pinhole]]* of the camera (or eye) and Direction is where the *ray* is going. 
```ad-important
title: Closest object
Through this representation the task to find the closest object becomes the task for finding the smallest t (t>0) where P(t) is a point on the surface of an object in the scene 

```
