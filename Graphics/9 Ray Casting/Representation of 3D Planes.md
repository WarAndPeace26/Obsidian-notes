# Representation of 3D Plains
***
Infinite Place is defined by
- P0 = (x0, y0,z0) -> *A central point that lies on it*
- n = (A,B,C) -> *Normal vector*

H(P) = Ax + By + Cz + D = 0
	= n.P + D = 0
```
Now, for D,
> > > Ax0 + By0 + Cz0 + D = 0 (P0 is on the plane)
> > > > D = - (Ax0 + By0 + Cz0)

title: Distance From a Plane

For any point P,
> H(P) = n.P + D

Will determine the (signed)distance of the point from said plane.
