# Calmness of Mind
## Even in a Snap of Your Fingers there are millions of instances of time
Because your mind is already involved in following the breath.
This way the feeling of existing can be emphasized in each moment of time.
## Shikantaza
1. No movement
2. No expectation
3. As if it was my last moment

Moment after moment the last instant is to be felt. Feel every moment of inhalation and inhalation, moments that are countless.

## Exhale Without Trying
It's a strange concept. I'm focusing on my breathing. I cannot exhale without trying. Wonder if it is because of my state of health.
