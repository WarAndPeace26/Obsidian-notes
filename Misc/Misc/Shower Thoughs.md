With time, aging speeds up. And with age, time speeds up. The ever accelerating recursion of mortality illudes its playthings just by staying in the very corner of their vision. It attempts to keep them from realizing that youth is only a critical point, a peak. And they stay upright, rigid, oblivious to the fact that a peak is only defined by the falls on either side of it.

They stand rigid like legs, trunkless. As the decay and dust on either side eye them silently. 

And someday, when the recursion finally stops, their gravestones will also illude the attention of the onlookers to the Works they left behind. 

Look upon my Works, ye Mighty, and... despair.
