> I couldn't express how I felt the first time I laid my gaze upon the coral reefs. They were red. The symbiotic algae made them resplendent. In the resplendence of the sea where every millilitre is full of millions of lives, the reef really had a conspicuous resplendence. But much to my dismay, when I went to see them again, they were white, lifeless, on their way out. Quite like myself. A part of me thinks that... it's a sort of a goodbye I'm getting from this world. As insignificant as I am, that is how I feel.
