# PRINCIPALS OF PERSONAL VISION

> You are not your feelings. You are not your moods. You are not even your thoughts. 

Casting yourself to a corner of the room and looking at yourself from an outside perspective. An endowment afforded to humans. To be integrated to #castle.

- *Environmental Determinism*

##### Between Stimulus and Response
**Victor Frankl**
> Between stimulus and response, Man has the ability to choose.

##### Human endowments
- Imagination: Ability to create
- Conscience: An inner feeling of right and wrong
- Independent Will: The ability to act on our self awareness. Free from influences

##### Proactivity Defined
> *The ability to subordinate an impulse to value is the essence of the proactive person.*

Proactivity does not mean you are free from external stimuli. It means you can control your responses.

##### Taking the Initiative
Use your R and I (Resourcefulness and Initiative)
##### Listening to our Language
Reactive Language and Proactive Language

Grow your circle of influence along with your circle of concern
##### Direct, Indirect and No Control

 > "Lord, give me 
 > - the **Courage** to change what can and ought to be changed, 
 > - the **Serenity** to accept the things that cannot be changed,
 > - and the **Wisdom** to know the difference"

##### The Have's and the Be's
When/if I had -> Probably reactive.
Be -> Proactive.
Be a better listener. Be a better student. The power *is* in your hands.

##### The Other End of the Stick
You are not free from the consequences of your mistakes.

##### Making and Keeping Commitments
1. Make a promise -> *Keep it.*
2. Set a goal -> *work to achieve it.*
