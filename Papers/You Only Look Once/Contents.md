# You Only Look Once
## Abstract
1. Instead of **Classification** we go with **Regression**
2. Single Neural Network
	1. End to end optimization less complex
3. Base YOLO Model 45 fps. 
4. Fast YOLO 155 frames.
5. More localization errors but less false positives.
6. General representations learns.

Sliding window approach.


## 2.4 Limitations
"Not a *fine* system. Issues due to being hammer handed"
