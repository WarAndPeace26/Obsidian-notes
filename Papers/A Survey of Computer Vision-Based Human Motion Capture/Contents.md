# A Survey of Computer Vision-Based Human Motion Capture
## Introduction
Large scale movement. Not facial or hand gestures.

### Application Areas
#### Surveillance
Security camera
#### Control
AR, VR
#### Analysis
Medical/detective.

### Alternative Technologies for Motion Capture
1. **Active**
	1. Mounted devices (Ishmam's step counting watch thingy)
	2. Uses: Application areas 2 (*Control*) & 3 (*Analysis*)
	3. Well-controlled environment
2. **Passive**
	1. Mounted devices not required.
	2. Used mostly in Application Area 2 (*Surveillance*) but in some cases, 3 (*Control*)
3. **Markers**
	> Even though the use of markers may seem a good compromise between passive and active sensing, it is still inconvenient for the subject (sometimes im-possible) and computer vision allows in principle for touchfree and more discrete “pure” motion capture systems.
```ad-summary
title: Markers

Markers are tracking devices that are attached to the subject.
1. Inconvenient to wear ahead of time.
2. "And computer vision allows in principle for touchfree and more discrete “pure” motion capture systems.""
