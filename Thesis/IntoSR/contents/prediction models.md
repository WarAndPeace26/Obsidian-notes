SISR algorithms in this category generate HR images from LR inputs through a **predefined mathematical formula** without training data. Interpolation-based methods (bilinear, bicubic, and Lanczos) generate HR pixel intensities by weighted averaging neighboring LR pixel values. Since interpolated intensities are locally similar to neighboring pixels, **these algorithms generate good smooth regions but insufficient large gradients along edges and at high-frequency regions**. 

The IP method *[[Improving resolution by image registration]]* exploits a predefined downsampling model from a HR image to a LR image. Given an initial HR image, this method iteratively generates a LR image through the predefined downsampling model and compensates the difference map in LR back to the HR image. Since a generated HR image is designed to best match the LR input image under the linear downsampling model, the contrast along edges is better enhanced than the results generated by bicubic interpolation.
