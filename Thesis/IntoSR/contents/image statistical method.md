Various *image properties* can be exploited as *priors* to predict HR images from LR images. The heavy-tailed gradient distribution ([[Statistics of natural images and models]]) is exploited in [[Fast image-video upsampling]] for SISR. *The [[sparsity property]]* of large gradients in generic images is exploited in [[Single-image super-resolution using sparse regression and natural image prior]] to reduce the computational load and in [[Robust web image-video superresolution]] to regularize the LR input images. *Total variation* has also been used as a regularization term for generating HR images [1, 48].
