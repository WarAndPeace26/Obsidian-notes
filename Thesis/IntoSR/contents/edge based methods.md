# Edge Based Methods
***
Edges are important primitive image structures that play a prime role in visual perception. Several SISR algorithms have been proposed to learn priors from edge features for reconstructing HR images. Various edge features have been proposed such as the depth and width of an edge Image upsampling via *[[imposed edge statistics]]* or the parameter of a gradient profile *[[Image super-resolution using gradient profile prior]]*. Since the priors are primarily learned from edges, the reconstructed HR images have high-quality edges with proper sharpness and limited artifacts. However, **edge priors are less effective for modeling other high-frequency structures such as textures**.
