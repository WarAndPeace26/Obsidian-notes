# Super resolution
Low res to high res.
### Applications:
1. Surveillance: Facial recognition on security cameras.
2. Medical: HR MRI from LR MRI images
3. Media: Reduce server costs.

## Purpose
```ad-attention
title: Super Res purposes

LR images can be obtained from HR images using a **Degradation** formula:
 ![[Pasted image 20220128142009.png]]
I<sub>x</sub> = LR Image
I<sub>y</sub> = HR image
D and Ïƒ are unknown. The task of the neural network is to find the inverse function of degradation using just I<sub>y</sub> which will be provided.
