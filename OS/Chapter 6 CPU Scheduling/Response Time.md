# Response Time Criterion
***
Turnaround time isn't the best criterion in an interactive system. It may be limited by the speed of the output device.

```ad-note
title: Response Time

The amount of time from Submission of a request until the First Response is produced.


Notice that the ending point of this time is when the first response is *produced*, not output.
