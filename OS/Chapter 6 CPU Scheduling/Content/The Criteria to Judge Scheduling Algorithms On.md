# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Judging Criteria
***
The different properties of the different CPU algorithms can cause a particular algorithm to favor one class of processes over another.

To determine the best suited algorithm, the criteria mentioned below are used:
1. [[CPU Utilization]]
2. [[Throughput]]
3. [[Turnaround Time]]
4. [[Waiting Time]]
5. [[Response Time]]

The goal of Algorithms is to maximize CPU Utilization and Throughput and to minimize Turnaround Time, Waiting Time and Response Time.

title: Interactive Systems and Response Time

For interactive systems, such as a desktop, it is more preferred to minimize the Variance of Response time instead of bringing down the average response time. This adds predictability to the device.
