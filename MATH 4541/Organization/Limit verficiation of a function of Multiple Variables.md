The purpose is to find a Delta. A delta for which the limit is true. 

If we look at the current case, we were given a possible limit and asked whether that is a possible limit. For it to be a possible limit it would have to pass the "Epsilon test" which we assumed that it did. And then, we based a Delta on that assumed epsilon.

So basically,
> For each epsilon > 0, there exists a delta-neighborhood around (a,b) that passes the epsilon test.
