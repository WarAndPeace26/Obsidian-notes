#### Let's build further upon the idea of the Delta-Neighborhood
So, for a Delta neighborhood to *be*, all the points in that neighborhood (Of course, around the (x0,y0) coordinates) have to map to the same limit. Basically,
> Approach the same limit from ALL directions.

So, if the points map to different values for different points of the neighborhood, there exists no limit. **Which means,** if approaching from different directions brings about different limits (Because we cannot access the points within the Delta-neighborhood any other way; Delta is very small so we have to take advantage of -> concept), then the limit does not exist.
