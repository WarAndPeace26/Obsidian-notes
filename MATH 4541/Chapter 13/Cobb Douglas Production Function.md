If x This function is used to measure the *number of units* produced by varying amount of *capital* and *labor*. If **x measures the unit of capital** and **y measures the unit of capital** then the number of units produced is given by
***
		f(x,y)= C(x^a)(y^(1-a))
***
Here *C* and *a* are constants
