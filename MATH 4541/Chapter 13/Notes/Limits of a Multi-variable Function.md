title: Single Variable Limit vs Multi-Variable Limit

In the case of a single variable limit, the limit could be reached from either left side (Left handed limit) or the right side (Right handed limit).

BUT in the case of a multi-variable function, the limiting point (x0,y0) can be approached from all directions.

And if the limit when approached from any two directions don't match, then the limit doesn't exist. 


```

3. [[A Limit That Does Not Exist]]
