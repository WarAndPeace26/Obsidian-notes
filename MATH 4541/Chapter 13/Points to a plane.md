1. *Interior Point:*
	If there is a point in the region R for which it's Del neighborhood is completely on R, then the point is called an **Interior point** of R.
2.  *Open Region:*
	If every point is R's interior point, then R is an **Open Region**.
3.  *Boundary Point:*
	If the Del neighborhood of a point (on the R plane) contains points on the R plane as well as points outside of the R plane, then that point is one of R's **Boundary Points**.
4.  *Closed Region:*
	If R contains all of its boundary points, then R is a **Closed Region**.
